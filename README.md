# test-react-webpack 

This project is a boilerplate for a React project compiled with Webpack and deployed as a Go static file service packaged with Docker.  

Check `package.json` to see available yarn commands.  The `Dockerfile` copies `dist/production`, whose content is served by the `Go` service.
